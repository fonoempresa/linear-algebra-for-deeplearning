**Deep Learning**: Deep Learning is a subdomain of machine learning, concerned with the algorithm which imitates the function and structure of the brain called the artificial neural network.

When confined to smaller levels, everything is math behind deep learning. So it is important to understand basic linear algebra before getting started with deep learning and programming it.
